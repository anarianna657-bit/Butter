# Butter - Game Concept

## Player goal
Get butter back in stock by completing short tasks and serving it to customers.

## Core loop (what the player does)
1. Start game
2. Choose avatar
3. Realize you’re out of butter (short cutscene)
4. Go outside to the cows/field
5. Complete a mini-game (milking)
6. Return to the store and churn into butter (also a mini-game)
7. Repeat with new tasks / upgrades (all tasks are tap based mini-games)

## Screens (MVP)
- Credits
- Loading 
- Title screen: “Butter” + Play button
- Choose avatar screen (girl / boy / androgynous)
- Store scene + cutscene trigger
- Field scene (first activity)

## Mini-game ideas (tap friendly)
- Milk the cow (tap to fill bucket)
- Collect ingredients (tap to pick up)
- Stir / churn (timed taps)
- Package butter (drag/tap)

## Art + mood
Soft, cozy, pastel, no pressure, simple animations, satisfying sound effects.

## Notes
- Keep MVP tiny: title, avatar, field mini-game.
- Everything else can be added after the first playable build.
